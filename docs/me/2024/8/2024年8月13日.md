a good proof must also be clear. Correctness and clarity usually go together

several guidelines:
1.state your game plan
2.keep a linear flow
3.a proof is an essay,not a calculation
4.Avoid excessive symbolism
5.revise and simplify

When algorithms and protocols only “mostly work” due to reliance on hand-waving arguments, the results can range from problematic to catastrophic

>"Hand-waving" refers to the use of vague or superficial explanations that are not fully grounded in solid reasoning or evidence. It's often used to describe situations where someone glosses over complex details, assumes things will work without proper justification, or relies on intuition rather than rigorous proof. In technical or scientific contexts, "hand-waving" can be seen as a warning that the argument or solution might not be reliable or fully thought out.

So we really hope that you’ll develop the ability to formulate rock-solid logical arguments that a system actually does what you think it does!
