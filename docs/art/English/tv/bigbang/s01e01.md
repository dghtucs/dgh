Should we have invited her for lunch?
这里的have invited表示a past possibility or missed opportunity，这里强调Leonerd有点懊悔刚才没有邀请Penny来吃饭
"Should we invite her for lunch?" → This is asking about a present or future action.

"Should we have invited her for lunch?" → This is asking about whether inviting her in the past would have been the right decision.
同样的例子还有
"We should have studied more for the test." → We didn’t study enough, and now we regret it.

"Should I have told her the truth?" → I'm wondering if telling her the truth in the past was the right choice.
