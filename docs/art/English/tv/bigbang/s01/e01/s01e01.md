In the phrase "Here I sit, broken-hearted", "Here I sit" is a way of describing one's current state or situation.

Context and Meaning:
This phrase is actually a reference to a common joke or piece of restroom graffiti:

"Here I sit, broken-hearted,
Tried to poop but only farted."

This is a humorous and well-known rhyme often found scribbled in public restrooms.

Breaking It Down:
"Here I sit" → Means "I am sitting here", usually referring to sitting on a toilet.

"Broken-hearted" → A humorous exaggeration of disappointment, in this case, about an unsuccessful bathroom trip.

In the context of The Big Bang Theory, the character is joking that the differential equation being referenced is as common and trivial as this famous piece of restroom graffiti.

i'm a sagittarius
which probably tells you way more than you need to know
yes,it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the sun's apparent position 
ralative to arbitrarily defined constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality
这又是一个长难句
"The sun's apparent position" refers to the position of the sun relative to certain constellations in the sky at the time of your birth.

"Arbitrarily defined constellations" points out that the constellations are subjectively defined and don't have a universal meaning across all cultures or throughout history.

The speaker is poking fun at the idea that this position can somehow influence or determine someone's personality.

The speaker is mocking astrology by suggesting that claiming one's astrological sign (e.g., Sagittarius) is a way of participating in an unfounded, widespread belief that the position of celestial bodies at birth can influence personality. The sarcasm implies that astrology is unscientific and not a reliable way to understand a person’s character.

Anyways,im also writing a screenplay
It;s about a sensitive girl who comes to la from lincoln nebraska
tobe a actress and winds up at the cheesecake factory
so it's based on your life
no im from Omaha
If that was movie,i would go see it
最后一句为什么用过去式

The last sentence "If that was a movie, I would go see it" uses the past tense "was" in a hypothetical situation, which is a common structure in English when talking about imaginary or unreal scenarios.

“Hate someone’s guts”是一个常见的英语习语，尤其在口语中用来表达强烈的厌恶情绪。它起源于“guts”作为人体核心部位的隐喻，逐渐演变为表示一个人的内在本质。这种用法在英语国家非常自然，特别是在非正式场合。

这个短语常用于表达负担、惊讶或情绪的叠加。例如：
“I have so much work to do, and now, on top of everything else, my computer crashed.”
（我已经有很多工作要做了，现在除了其他一切之外，我的电脑还坏了。）

“She’s rude, selfish, and, on top of everything else, she never apologizes.”
（她很粗鲁，很自私，而且在所有这些之上，她从不道歉。）

Really?would it be totally weird if i used it?
“Would”是助动词“will”的过去式，在这里表示一种假设情况，而不是实际发生的事实。这是一种虚拟语气的标志，用于讨论可能性或想象中的情景。

“Point taken” 是一个英语短语，意思是“我明白了你的意思”或“你的观点我接受了”。它通常用在对话中，表示说话者认可对方提出的看法、论点或纠正，并且愿意根据这个观点调整自己的说法或立场。语气上，它往往是简洁且略带让步的，既承认对方的意见，又不展开过多争辩。

do you think this posibility will be helped or hindered
when she discovers your luke skywalker no-more-tears shampoo

I’d say it could go either way—helped or hindered—depending on her sense of humor! If she’s a Star Wars fan and appreciates a good laugh, discovering a “Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo” might help the possibility. I mean, who wouldn’t be charmed by a guy with Jedi-themed grooming products that promise no crying? It’s quirky and endearing—might even make her stick around longer, clothes or no clothes!
But if she’s not into sci-fi puns or thinks it’s too weird, it could hinder things. She might raise an eyebrow and wonder what kind of nerd she’s dealing with—maybe even bolt for the door! So, I guess it hinges on whether she’d say, “Use the Force, that’s hilarious!” or “I’ve got a bad feeling about this…”

hang on ,there really is a lady here?
and you want us out because youre anticipating coitus?
so she's available for coitus?

“Coitus interruptus”是一个拉丁词，直译是“中断的性交”，指的是性行为中途停止（通常是为了避孕，男性在高潮前退出）。  

在这里，说话者用这个词制造了一个双关语（pun）：  
前一句是“能不能别老说coitus”，意思是想停止使用这个词。  

最后一句接茬说“如果停下来，那就是coitus interruptus”，把“停止说coitus”和“性交中途停止”联系起来，玩了个文字游戏。

幽默点：这句故意用了一个更复杂的术语（coitus interruptus）来回应“别说coitus”的请求，既没停用“coitus”，还升级了笑点，显得很机智又有点调皮。

i really think we should examine the chain of causality here
must we? event A
a beautiful woman stand naked in our shower
event B
we drive halfway across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend


在“we drive halfway across town”中：  
字面意思：“Halfway” 是“半路”或“一半”的意思，指的是距离上的一半。  

具体含义：  
“Across town” 表示“穿过镇子”或“到镇子的另一边”，通常指从一个地方到镇子的对侧（可能是整个镇子的宽度或长度）。  

“Halfway across town” 就是“穿过镇子一半的距离”或“到镇子中间”。  

所以这句话的意思是：他们开车走了镇子一半的路程，去取电视机，但并没有走完全程（到对侧）。

翻译：“我们开车到镇子一半的地方” 或 “我们开了半个镇的路”。
