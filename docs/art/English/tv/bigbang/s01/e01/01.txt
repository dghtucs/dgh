so if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed,it will not go through both slits.
if it's unobserved , it will
However , if it's observed after it's left the plane but before it hits its target,it wont have gone through both slits.
agreed, what's your point?
there 's no point ,i just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt
Excuse me ? Hang on.
One across is aegean.
Eight down is nabokov
26 across is mcm
14 down is ... move your finger
phylum which makes 14 across port-au-prince
see,papa doc's capitol idea,that's port-au-prince,Haiti
can i help you, yes
Is this the high-iq sperm bank
If you have to ask,maybe you shouldn't be here
I think this is the place 
fill these out ,thank you
we'll be right back,oh take your time
I'll just finish my crossword puzzle
oh,wait
Leonerd ,i don't think i can do this
What ,are you kidding, you are a semi-pro
No, we are commiting genetic fraud
There's no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high-iq offspring

think about that ,I have a sister with the same basic dna mix

who hostesses at fuddruckers
Sheldon ,this was your idea

A little extra money to get fractional T-1 bandwidth in the apartment

I know, and i do yearn for faster downloads

But there's some poor woman who's gonna pin hopes on my sperm

What if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve?

i'm sure she'll still love him. i wouldn't
well ,what do you want to do
i want to leave.
what's the protocol for leaving?

i dont know ive never reneged on a proffer of sperm before

lets try just walking out
bye,nice meeting you
Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
No
you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Not really
If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimeters,most people will trip
i dont care
two millimeters? that doesn't seem right
No it's true,i did a series of experiments when i was 12

My father broke his clavicle

Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
No,that was a result of my work with lasers
New neighbor
Evidently
significant improvement over the old neighbor

200-pound transvestite with a skin condition?
Yes,she is
oh,hi
we dont mean to interrupt. we live across the hall
oh, that's nice
We dont live together, i mean 
We live together,but in seperate,heterosexual bedrooms
okay,well,Guess i'm your new neighbor,Penny
Leonerd,Sheldon
Well, welcome to the building
thank you,maybe we can have coffee sometime
Great

Should we have invited her for lunch?

No ,We're gonna start season two of battlestar galatica
We alreadly watched the season two dvds
Not with commentary
i think we should be good neighbors
invite her over,make her feel welcome
we never invite louie-slash-louise over
that was wrong of us
we need to widen our circle
i have a very wide circle
i have 212 friends on my space
yes ,and you've never met one of them
that's the beauty of it
i'm gonna invite her over
we'll have a nice meal and chat
chat we dont chat ,at least not offline
it's not difficult
you just listen what she says and you say something appropriate in response
To what end
hi,again
Anyway
We brought home Indian food
I know that moving can be stressful
And i find that when i'm undergoing stress
good food and company can have a comforting effect
Also curry is a natural laxative and i dont have to tell you
that ,you know , a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about

Leonerd ,I'm no expert,but i believe in the context of a luncheon invitation,
you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements

You're inviting me over to eat?
yes
oh that's so nice,i'd love to
so,what do you guys do for fun around here
Today we tried masturbating for money
Okay,well,make yourself at home
thank you,you are very welcome
This looks like some serious stuff
Leonerd ,did you do this?
actually,that's my work
yeah,well,just some quantum mechanics
with a little string theory doodling around the edges
that part there,that's a joke
It's a proof of born-oppenheimer approximation
so you're like one of those beautiful mind genius guys
This is really impressive 
i have a board
if you like boards,this is my board
Holy smokes

If by holy smokes,you mean
a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at mit ,sure

what?come on
who hasn't seen this differential below "here i sit,broken-hearted"

At least i didn't have to invent 26 dimensions just to make the math come out
i didnt invent them,they are there
in what universe,in all of them,that is the point
do you guys mind if i start?
Penny,that's where i sit
so sit next to me
no , i sit there
what's the difference
here we go
in the winter ,that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm,and yet not so close as to cause perspiration
In the summer,it's directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there
It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct,thus dicouraging conversation
Nor so far wide as to create a parallax distortion
I could go on,but i think i ve made my point
Do you want me to move
well ,just sit somewhere else
well,this is nice
we dont have a lot of company over
that's not true,k and w come over all the time
yes i know,but
tuesday night,we played klingon boggle till 1:00 in the moring

I resent you say we dont have company
that has negative social implications
yeah,it's like regular boggle,but in klingon
that's probably enough about us ,so tell us about you
me?ok
i'm a sagittarius
which probably tells you way more than you need to know

yes,it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the sun's apparent position 
ralative to arbitrarily defined constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality

participate in the waht?
i think what Sheldon's trying to say is that sagittarius wouldnt have been our first guess
yeah,a lot of people think im a water sign
ok lets see,what else
im vegetarian,except for fish,
and the occasional steak,i love steak
well,that's interesting
leonerd cant process corn
do you have some sort of a job
im a waitress at the cheesecake factory
you are lactose-intolerant
i dont eat it ,i just think it a good idea
Anyways,im also writing a screenplay
It;s about a sensitive girl who comes to la from lincoln nebraska
tobe a actress and winds up at the cheesecake factory
so it's based on your life
no im from Omaha
If that was movie,i would go see it
Guess that's about it
that's the story of penny
it sounds wonderful
it was,until i fell love with a jerk
God you know,4years i lived with him
it's like as long as high school
it took you 4 years to get through high school?
it just,i cant believe i trusted him
should i say something?i feel like i should say something
you,no you'll only make it worse
you want to know the most pathetic part?
even though i hate his lying ,cheating guts
i still love him
is that crazy?
no its not crazy,its a paradox
paradoxes are part of nature,think about light
if you look at huygens,light is a wave
As confirmed by the double-slit experiments
but then along comes albert einstein
and discovers that light behaves like particles too
well,i didnt make it worse
im so sorry,im such a mess

on top of everything else, im all gross from moving

and my stupid shower doesnt even work
our shower works

Really?would it be totally weird if i used it?
it's right down the hall
you guys are really sweet
well,this is an interesting development
how so

it has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment

that's not true,remember at thanksgiving
my grandmother with alzheimer's had that episode

point taken,it has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off, after which we dont want to rip our eyes out

the worst was watching her carve that turkey
So what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?
That woman is not going to have sex with you
im not trying to have sex with her
oh good, you wont be disappointed
what makes you think she wouldnt have sex with me
im a male she's a female
yes but not of same species
im not gonna to engage in hypotheticals here
im just trying to be a good neighbor

That's not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that i wouldnt participate
however briefly
do you think this posibility will be helped or hindered
when she discovers your luke skywalker no-more-tears shampoo
it's darth vader shampoo
conditioner
wait till you see this,its fantastic,unbelievable
it's a stephen hawking lecture from mit in 1974
this isnt a good time
its before he become a creepy computer voice
that;s great you guys have to go
its just not a good time
leonerd has a lady over
yeah,right ,your grandmother back in town?
she s not  a lady,she's a new neighbor
hang on ,there really is a lady here?
and you want us out because youre anticipating coitus?
so she's available for coitus?
can we please just stop saying coitus?
Technically,that would be coitus interruptus

is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower?
h,caltech department of applied physics
you maybe familiar with some of my work
it's currently orbiting jupiter's largest moon
taking high-resolution digital photographs
Penny,i work at cheesecake factory

I'll show you the trick with the shower
it's a sentiment i can say in 6 languages
save it for your blog
all right ,there it goes,it sticks,im sorry

you are gonna to step right
hey leonerd,the hair products are sheldon's
can i ask you a favor
sure,you can ask me a favor,i would do you a favor for you
it's okay if you say no
oh i probably say yes
it's just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you just met

i really think we should examine the chain of causality here
must we? event A
a beautiful woman stand naked in our shower
event B
we drive halfway across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend

Query,on what plane of existance
is there even a semi-rational link between these events

she asked me to do her a favor,sheldon
yes ,well that may be the proximal cause of our journey
But we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause
which is ,you think with your penis
that's a biological impossibility,and you didnt have to come
yeah,i could have stayed behind and watch w try to hit on Penny
in russian,arabic and farsi
why cant she get her own tv
come on ,you know how it is with breakups
no i dont ,and neither do you
i broke up with joyce kim
you didnt break up with joyce kim,she defected to north korea
to mend her broken heart
this situation is much less complicated
There's some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex boyfriend
as to who gets custody of the tv
she just wanted to avoid having a scene with him
so we get to have a scene with him?
sheldon,there's not going to be a scene
there's two of us and one of him
the two of us cant even carry a tv
so you guys work with s and l in the university?
im sorry,do u speak english
he speaks english,he just cant speak to woman
really why
he's kind of a nerd
juice box
i'll do the talking
hi im l,this is s
hello,what did i just
we're here to pick up penny's tv
get lost
ok thank for your time
we are not going to give up just like that
l,the tv's in the building
we've been denied access to the building,ergo,we are done

exccuse me ,if i were to give up on the first little hitch
i never would have identified the fingerprints of string theory
in the aftermath of the big bang

my apologies,what's your plan
it's just a privilege to watch your mind at work
come on we have a combined iq of 360
we should be able to figure out how to get into that stupid building
what do you think their combined iq is
just grab the door
i'll do the talking
good thinking ,i'll just be the muscle
from the intercom
how the hell did you get into the building
we are scientists
tell him about our iq
my mum bought me those pants
im sorry
you're going to have to call her
sheldon,im sos sorry i dragged you through this
it's ok,it's not my first pantsing and it wont be my last
and you are right about my motives
i was hoping to establish a relationship with penny
that might have  someday led to sex
you got me out of my pants
anyway,i've learned my lesson
she's out of my league,i'm done with her
 got my work,one day i will win the nobel prize
and i will die alone
dont think like that ,you are not going to die alone
thank you sheldon, you are a good friend
and you are certainly not going to win a nobel prize
this is one of my favorite places to kick back after a quest
they have a great house ale
cool tiger
yeah,i've had him since level ten
his name is buttons
anyway,if you had your own game character
we could hang out ,maybe go on a quest
that sounds interesting
you will think about it?
i dont think i will able to stop thinking about it
smooth
we are home
oh my god what happened
well your ex sends his regards
and i think the rest is fairly self-explanatory
im so sorry,i really thought if you guys went instead of me
he wouldnt be such an ass
no ,it was a valid hypothesis
that was a valid,what is happening to you
really,thank you so much for going and trying 
you are just so terrific,really
why dont you put some clothes on ,
i'll get my purse,and dinner is on me,okay
really ,ok
you are not done with her ,are you
our babies will be smart and beautiful
not to mention imaginary
is thai food okay with you ,penny
we cant have thai food
we had indian food for lunch,so
they are both curry-based cuisines,so
it would be gastronnomically redundant
i can see we're going to spell out everything for this girl
any ideas raj
Turn left on lake street and head up to colorado
i know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke
that sounds like fun
i dont know what the odds are in the world as a whole,
but as far as the population of this car goes
you’re  a  veritable  Mack 
Daddy.
