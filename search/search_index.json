present or future action. \"Should we have invited her for lunch?\" \u2192 This is asking about whether inviting her in the past would have been the right decision. \u540c\u6837\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u8fd8\u6709 \"We should have studied more for the test.\" \u2192 We didn\u2019t study enough, and now we regret it. \"Should I have told her the truth?\" \u2192 I'm wondering if telling her the truth in the past was the right choice. In this context, \"commentary\" refers to audio commentary, which is an additional feature included in DVDs or Blu-rays where the creators, directors, actors, or other involved people discuss the episode while it plays. the phrase \"might want to\" is a polite or indirect way of giving advice or making a suggestion. Meaning of \"might want to\" It means \"should\" or \"it would be better if you\", but in a softer, less direct way. It implies that it is advisable or a good idea to do something, without sounding too forceful. Rewriting the Sentence for Clarity Direct version: \"Leonard, don\u2019t mention bowel movements when inviting someone to lunch.\" Polite version: \"Leonard, you might want to avoid mentioning bowel movements when inviting someone to lunch.\" In the phrase \"Here I sit, broken-hearted\", \"Here I sit\" is a way of describing one's current state or situation. Context and Meaning: This phrase is actually a reference to a common joke or piece of restroom graffiti: \"Here I sit, broken-hearted, Tried to poop but only farted.\" This is a humorous and well-known rhyme often found scribbled in public restrooms. Breaking It Down: \"Here I sit\" \u2192 Means \"I am sitting here\", usually referring to sitting on a toilet. \"Broken-hearted\" \u2192 A humorous exaggeration of disappointment, in this case, about an unsuccessful bathroom trip. In the context of The Big Bang Theory, the character is joking that the differential equation being referenced is as common and trivial as this famous piece of restroom graffiti. i'm a sagittarius which probably tells you way more than you need to know yes,it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the sun's apparent position ralative to arbitrarily defined constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality \u8fd9\u53c8\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u957f\u96be\u53e5 \"The sun's apparent position\" refers to the position of the sun relative to certain constellations in the sky at the time of your birth. \"Arbitrarily defined constellations\" points out that the constellations are subjectively defined and don't have a universal meaning across all cultures or throughout history. The speaker is poking fun at the idea that this position can somehow influence or determine someone's personality. The speaker is mocking astrology by suggesting that claiming one's astrological sign (e.g., Sagittarius) is a way of participating in an unfounded, widespread belief that the position of celestial bodies at birth can influence personality. The sarcasm implies that astrology is unscientific and not a reliable way to understand a person\u2019s character. \u65e2\u7136\u8c08\u5230\u4e86\u661f\u5ea7\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e00\u4e0b Here\u2019s a list of all 12 zodiac signs, their English names, Chinese names, birth date ranges, and general personality traits: 1.

\u2192 I'm wondering if telling her the truth in the past was the right choice. In this context, \"commentary\" refers to audio commentary, which is an additional feature included in DVDs or Blu-rays where the creators, directors, actors, or other involved people discuss the episode while it plays. the phrase \"might want to\" is a polite or indirect way of giving advice or making a suggestion. Meaning of \"might want to\" It means \"should\" or \"it would be better if you\", but in a softer, less direct way. It implies that it is advisable or a good idea to do something, without sounding too forceful. Rewriting the Sentence for Clarity Direct version: \"Leonard, don\u2019t mention bowel movements when inviting someone to lunch.\" Polite version: \"Leonard, you might want to avoid mentioning bowel movements when inviting someone to lunch.\" In the phrase \"Here I sit, broken-hearted\", \"Here I sit\" is a way of describing one's current state or situation. Context and Meaning: This phrase is actually a reference to a common joke or piece of restroom graffiti: \"Here I sit, broken-hearted, Tried to poop but only farted.\" This is a humorous and well-known rhyme often found scribbled in public restrooms. Breaking It Down: \"Here I sit\" \u2192 Means \"I am sitting here\", usually referring to sitting on a toilet. \"Broken-hearted\" \u2192 A humorous exaggeration of disappointment, in this case, about an unsuccessful bathroom trip. In the context of The Big Bang Theory, the character is joking that the differential equation being referenced is as common and trivial as this famous piece of restroom graffiti. i'm a sagittarius which probably tells you way more than you need to know yes,it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the sun's apparent position ralative to arbitrarily defined constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality \u8fd9\u53c8\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u957f\u96be\u53e5 \"The sun's apparent position\" refers to the position of the sun relative to certain constellations in the sky at the time of your birth. \"Arbitrarily defined constellations\" points out that the constellations are subjectively defined and don't have a universal meaning across all cultures or throughout history. The speaker is poking fun at the idea that this position can somehow influence or determine someone's personality. The speaker is mocking astrology by suggesting that claiming one's astrological sign (e.g., Sagittarius) is a way of participating in an unfounded, widespread belief that the position of celestial bodies at birth can influence personality. The sarcasm implies that astrology is unscientific and not a reliable way to understand a person\u2019s character. \u65e2\u7136\u8c08\u5230\u4e86\u661f\u5ea7\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e00\u4e0b Here\u2019s a list of all 12 zodiac signs, their English names, Chinese names, birth date ranges, and general personality traits:","title":"\u53e5\u5b50"},{"location":"art/English/tv/bigbang/s01/e01/s01e01/#1-aries","text":"Date: March 21 - April 19 Personality Traits: Aries are known for being energetic , confident , and determined .

It works by randomly setting a fraction of the input units to zero at each update during training time, which helps to break the co-adaptation of neurons. This means that the model cannot rely on any specific neuron, and must learn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of the other neurons. \u671f\u6743 \u671f\u6743 \u671f\u6743\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u91d1\u878d\u884d\u751f\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8d4b\u4e88\u6301\u6709\u8005\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u4ee5\u7279\u5b9a\u4ef7\u683c\u4e70\u5165\u6216\u5356\u51fa\u6807\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u6743\u5229\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u4e49\u52a1\u3002\u671f\u6743\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u3002 \u671f\u6743\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7c7b\u578b\u5305\u62ec\u770b\u6da8\u671f\u6743\uff08Call Option\uff09\u548c\u770b\u8dcc\u671f\u6743\uff08Put Option\uff09\u3002\u770b\u6da8\u671f\u6743\u5141\u8bb8\u6301\u6709\u8005\u5728\u5230\u671f\u65e5\u6216\u4e4b\u524d\u4ee5\u6267\u884c\u4ef7\u683c\u8d2d\u4e70\u6807\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u800c\u770b\u8dcc\u671f\u6743\u5219\u5141\u8bb8\u6301\u6709\u8005\u4ee5\u6267\u884c\u4ef7\u683c\u51fa\u552e\u6807\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u3002 \u516c\u5f0f \u671f\u6743\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u901a\u5e38\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u7ec4\u6210\uff1a\u5185\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u5185\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u662f\u6307\u671f\u6743\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u5e02\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u800c\u65f6\u95f4\u4ef7\u503c\u5219\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u671f\u6743\u5230\u671f\u524d\u53ef\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6536\u76ca\u3002 \u671f\u6743\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5982Black-Scholes\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u671f\u6743\u7406\u8bba\u4ef7\u503c \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u6807\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u4ef7\u683c\u3001\u6267\u884c\u4ef7\u683c\u3001\u65e0\u98ce\u9669\u5229\u7387\u3001\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u548c\u5230\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u3002 \u671f\u6743\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u516c\u5f0f\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a - \u5185\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\uff08Call Option\uff09 = max(0, S - K) - \u5185\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\uff08Put Option\uff09 = max(0, K - S) - \u65f6\u95f4\u4ef7\u503c = \u671f\u6743\u4ef7\u683c - \u5185\u5728\u4ef7\u503c","title":"Class06"},{"location":"thu/d2/d2x/%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E5%AF%BC%E8%AE%BA/class/class06/#_1","text":"","title":"\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u7f51\u7edc"},{"location":"thu/d2/d2x/%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E5%AF%BC%E8%AE%BA/class/class06/#_2","text":"","title":"\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc"},{"location":"thu/d2/d2x/%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E5%AF%BC%E8%AE%BA/class/class06/#_3","text":"","title":"\u4e60\u9898"},{"location":"thu/d2/d2x/%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E5%AF%BC%E8%AE%BA/class/class06/#_4","text":"\u4e00\u79cd\u964d\u7ef4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5 \u5e73\u5747\u6c60\u5316\u548c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6c60\u5316","title":"\u6c60\u5316"},{"location":"thu/d2/d2x/%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E5%AF%BC%E8%AE%BA/class/class06/#letnet","text":"yang lecun\u53d1\u660e\u7684 Impact: LeNet was one of the first CNN architectures to show the power of deep learning, particularly in computer vision tasks.
