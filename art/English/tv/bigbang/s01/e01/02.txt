Here we go.pad thai,no peanuts
and does it has peanut oil?
im not sure
everyone keep an eye on howard in case he starts to swell up

since it's not bee season, you can have my epinephrine

are there any chopsticks.no need ,this is thai food
Here we go

Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the 19th century
interestingly they dont put the fork in their mouth
they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth
ask him for a napkin,i dare you
i'll get it
do i look puffy,i feel puffy
hey leonard,oh hi penny
am i interrupting
no
you are not swelling howard
no,look at  my fingers they're like vienna sausages
sounds like you have company,they are not going anywhere
so you're coming home from work,that's great,how was work
well,you know it's a cheesecake factory
people order cheesecake and i bring it to them
so you kind of act like a carbonhydrate delivery system
yeah,call it whatever you want,i get minimum wage
anyway i was wondering if you could help me out with something
great ,im having some furniture delivered tomorrow
and i may not be here ,so
im sorry,

havent you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless russian

no i havent
get used to it
yeah, i probably wont
hey sheldon
hey raj
still not talking to me huh
dont take it personally, its his pathology
he cant talk to women
he cant talk to attractive woman or in your case
cheesecake scented goddness
so there's gonna be some furniture delivered?
yeah,if it gets here and im not here,could you sign and have them put in my apartment
no problem
great ,here is my spare key
penny wait
if you dont have other plans,do you want to join us for thai food and a superman movie marathon
a marathon ,how many superman movies are there
you are kidding right?
i do like the one where lois lane falls from the helicopter
and superman swooshes down and catches her,which one was that
one
you realize that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy
yes i know men cant fly
nono,let's assume that they can
lois lane is falling
accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second
superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel
Miss lane who is now traveling at approximately 120 miles an hour
hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces
unless superman matches her speed and decelerates
in what space ,she's two feet above the ground
frankly,if he really loved her,he'd let her hit the pavement
It'd be a more merciful death
Excuse me ,your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that superman's flight is a feat of strength
Are you listening to yourself? it is well established that his flight is a feat of strength
It is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings
An ability he drives from exposure to earth's yellow sun
yeah,and you dont have a problem with that?
and how does he fly at night
A conbination of the moon's solar reflection and the energy-storage capacity of kryptonian skin cells
i just gonna go wash up 
i have 2600 comic books in there .i challenge you to find a single reference to kryptonian skin cells
challenge accepted
we're locked out
also,the pretty girl left
ok,her apartment's on the fourth floor but the elevator's broken,so
you're just gonna be done?
okay,cool,thanks
we'll just bring it up ourselves
i hardly think so
why not
wo dont have a dolly
or lifting belts or any measurable upper-body strength
We dont need strength,we're physicists
we are the intellectual descendants of archimedes

Give me a fulcrum and a lever and i can move the earth

it's just a matter of .. i dont have this
archemedes would be so proud
do you have any ideas
yes but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring
easy easy
now we've got a inclined plane.the force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs
call it 30 degrees,so about half
exactly half
let's push
see,it's moving ,it's easy
it's all in the math
what's your formula for the corner,what
okay,no problem
just come up here,help me pull and turn
ah,gravity,thou art a heartless bitch

you do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman
Men do things for woman without expecting sex,Those would be men who just had sex
i'm doing this to be a good neighbor
in any case, there's no way it could lower the odds

Almost there
no we're not
watch your fingers
oh god ,my fingers
you okay?
Great caesar's ghost,look at the place
so penny 's a little messy
a little messy
the mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy
this is chaos
excuse me
explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid
i'm just inferring this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table is having  a tiny garage sale 
Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort,organise and label the entire world around them?
no
well,they dont
Hard as it may be for you to believe
Most people dont sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fiber content
 excuse me ,but i think we've both found that helpful at times
come on ,we should go ,hang on
what are you doing,im straightening up
this is not your home
this is not anyone's home,this is a swirling vortex of entropy
when the transvestite lived here, you didnt care how he kept the place
because it was immaculate
i mean you open that man's closet
it was left to right evening gowns,cocktail dresses then his police uniforms
what were you doing in his closet?
i helped him run some cable for a web cam
hey guys
this just arrived,we just brought this up,just now
great,oh was it hard getting it up the stairs?
no
well,we'll get out of your hair
ok,great ,thank you again
penny,i just want you to know that you dont have to live like this
im here for you
what's he talking about
it's a joke,i dont get it
yeah,he didnt tell it right
penny's sleeping
are you insane
you cant just break into a woman's apartment in the middle of the night and clean
i have no choice,i couldnt sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room
and immediately adjacent to the hallway was this
there is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here

its reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers

you might want to speak in a lower register

granted, not long,but just deeply and well

a well-known folk cure for insomnia

and what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses

boy,you are all over the place this morning

i hope that it wont color your opinion of him

a gentle and thorough lover

they let themselves into my place

maybe i better off with an indian girl

you are a doll

grab a napkin,homie,you just got served

actually,i was less the chatter than the chatee

if water's involved,we're gonna have to ground the crap out of the thing
